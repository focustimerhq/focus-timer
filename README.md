## Installation

### Flatpak (recommended)

To get latest releases we recommend installing the app from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en/apps/io.github.focustimerhq.FocusTimer).

Installing from CLI:

```bash
flatpak install flathub io.github.focustimerhq.FocusTimer
flatpak run io.github.focustimerhq.FocusTimer
```

To migrate data from the old gnome-pomodoro app, copy file `~/.local/share/gnome-pomodoro/database.sqlite` to `~/.var/app/io.github.focustimerhq.FocusTimer/data/focus-timer/database.sqlite`.

The version on Flathub doesn't have the ability to run custom scripts, shown as *Automation* panel in the *Preferences* window.

### Distributions

Find a community-maintained package in your distro repos:

#### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install gnome-pomodoro
```

#### Arch Linux

Install `gnome-shell-pomodoro` from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-shell-pomodoro).

#### OpenSUSE

```bash
sudo zypper install gnome-pomodoro
```

### Building from source

To build the application from source, you will need `meson`, `ninja`, and the necessary development headers (GLib, GTK+, etc.).

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/focustimerhq/FocusTimer.git focus-timer
cd focus-timer
```

Build and install:
```bash
meson setup build --prefix=/usr
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install
```

Run:
```bash
focus-timer
```

The app will try to migrate data from the old gnome-pomodoro app at first run.

If you decide to uninstall it. Run: `sudo ninja -C build uninstall`.
